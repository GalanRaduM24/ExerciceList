# Paths Intersection

## Overview
This project involves finding the intersection point of two linked lists that represent routes. Each node in the list represents a city, and you need to determine the city where two given routes intersect.

## Project Structure
The project is structured with the following files:

- Main.cpp: The main program that initializes the routes and finds their intersection.
- List.h: Contains the definition of the Ville struct and Route class, which manages the cities and routes.

## Compilation and Execution
Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
```
g++ -o main Main.cpp
```
Run the compiled program.
```
./main
```
